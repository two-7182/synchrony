# Cortical spike synchrony as a measure of contour uniformity
Neurons in the brain cortex can fire synchronously in various situations. This project is modeling synchronous firing in *primary visual cortex*, or *V1 area*. It is the continuation of the research of Korndörfer et al. (2017), which is described in the detail later.

## Biological grounds
Synchrony in V1 is possible due to horizontal connections between neurons (Stettler et al., 2002). Stronger connections lead to a greater synchrony. The strength of connections depends on two factors:
- input familiarity,
- geometrical characteristics of the input image.

Input familiarity means that the neurons have seen the similar input before. This is in focus of the paper of Korndörfer et al. (2017). If the neurons are familiar with the input, the horizontal connections are stronger.

What about the geometrical characteristics?
